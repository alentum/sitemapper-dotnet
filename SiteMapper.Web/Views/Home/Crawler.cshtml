<h2>Visual Site Mapper Crawler</h2>

<p>Visual Site Mapper is a service that shows maps of sites by crawling site pages. Users of our service can request a map of any site.</p>

<p> If you wish to disallow the Visual Site Mapper crawler to index all or some pages on your site, 
    you can do it by adding rules to disallow access to these pages for crawler VSMCrawler to the robots.txt file.</p>

<p> For example:</p>
<p class="code">
    User-Agent: VSMCrawler<br />
    Disallow: /
</p>
